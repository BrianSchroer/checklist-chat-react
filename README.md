# Checklist Chat

This repo contains code for a "checklist chat" web app that combines chat with a checklist of tasks, showing the scheduling and status of each task:

It's based on an ASP.NET MVC / SignalR / jQuery app that I developed for a hackathon at work (and won first prize!).

During multi-phase deployments we had phone conference calls and people were constantly coming and going and asking for a verbal update of the status of the deployment tasks. I thought it would be a good communication tool to keep everyone appraised of statuses and issues.

It's been my testbed for learning [**âš›React**](https://reactjs.org/) and associated
modern web development techniques and tools, including:

* ES6 / ECMAScript2015 and beyond
* [git](https://git-scm.com/) / [github](https://github.com)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)
